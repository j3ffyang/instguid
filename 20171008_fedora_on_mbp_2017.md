# Fedora 27 on MacBook Pro 2017

## Document Objective
- Install latest (up to this document made) Fedora 27 beta on MacBook Pro 2017 14,2 ([official product model](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/HT201300))
- Fix touchbar, keyboard and touchpad issues

#### Document Reference
- [Linux on MBP Late 2016 by gist.github.com/roadrunner2](https://gist.github.com/roadrunner2/1289542a748d9a104e7baec6a92f9cd7)
- [State of Linux on the MacBook Pro 2016 & 2017](https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux)

#### Pre- requisite
- ```yum install git kernel-devel-$(uname -r) elfutils-libelf-devel```

## keyboard/ Touchpad/ Touchbar

For this we need the drivers from https://github.com/roadrunner2/macbook12-spi-driver.git (a clone of https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver which includes a preliminary touchbar driver and keyboard fixes). The following commands set this up.

```
git clone https://github.com/roadrunner2/macbook12-spi-driver.git
pushd macbook12-spi-driver
git checkout touchbar-driver-hid-driver
make
sudo mkdir /lib/modules/`uname -r`/custom/
sudo cp applespi.ko appletb.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/custom/
sudo depmod
popd
```

Next we need to set the proper dpi for the touchpad (download the [61-evdev-local.hwdb](https://gist.github.com/roadrunner2/1289542a748d9a104e7baec6a92f9cd7#file-61-evdev-local-hwdb) from this gist):

```
sudo cp 61-evdev-local.hwdb /etc/udev/hwdb.d/
```

Test the drivers by loading them and their dependencies:

```
sudo modprobe intel_lpss_pci spi_pxa2xx_platform applespi appletb
```

You'll want these loaded on boot, so rebuild the initramfs (download the [keyboard.conf](https://gist.github.com/roadrunner2/1289542a748d9a104e7baec6a92f9cd7#file-keyboard-conf) from this gist):

```
sudo mv /boot/initramfs-`uname -r`.img{,.orig}
sudo cp keyboard.conf /etc/dracut.conf.d/keyboard.conf
sudo dracut
```

Then reboot to take the change effective

## Fixes

#### ```firewalld``` taking long time during shutdown
###### Reference
- [Change ```firewalld.conf```](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1294415#c10)
